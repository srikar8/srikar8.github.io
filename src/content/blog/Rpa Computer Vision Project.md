## Extract text from Screentshots to Excel

Background

Recently, I had received them from @[SrikarRaoPhotography](https://srikarraophotography.com/).  They needed to extract detailed text from a set of screenshots and organize it into an Excel spreadsheet. Which will be useful for further analysis of the data. Manually entering these details would have been extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive, so automation was the obvious solution.

## The Task



The primary objective was to extract the following details from each screenshot:

**1. Name Category**

**2. Type of Event**

**3. Party Time**

**4.  Duration**

**5. Format of Pictures**

**6. Approximate Budget**

**7. Date of the Party**

**8. Party Location**

Using **RPA [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/) Computer Vision Tool**, I managed to automate the process efficiently.

## The Solution

## Tools and Techniques
To tackle the problem, I utilized:
UiPath Computer Vision Tool: This tool helped in accurately extracting the required data fields from the screenshots.
Google Cloud Vision OCR Engine and Microsoft OCR Engine: These were used to enhance the accuracy of text extraction.

## Process Overview
Setup: Configured the UiPath workflow to identify and extract the specified data fields from each screenshot.
Execution: Ran the automation process to extract data from all the screenshots and store it in an Excel file.
Validation: Ensured the extracted data was accurate and organized correctly in the Excel file.


## Efficiency
Total time to configure the process: 30 minutes
Total time to process 400 screenshots: 6 hours 25 minutes and 45 seconds
While the process took a considerable amount of time, it was significantly faster than manual data entry.
