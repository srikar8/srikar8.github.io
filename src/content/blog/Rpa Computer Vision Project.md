# Extract text from Screentshots to Excel


There are set of screenshots in a folder. The text details present in screenshot has to be noted in an Excel separate columns. Which will be useful for further analysis of the data.

I had received them from @[SrikarRaoPhotography](https://srikarraophotography.com/). They said they are too busy to manually enter each detail to Excel And it is super Important for them.

Using **RPA [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/) Computer Vision Tool**, I had extracted data from all the screenshot images.

**1. Name Category**

**2. Type of Event**

**3. Party Time**

**4.  Duration**

**5. Format of Pictures**

**6. Approximate Budget**

**7. Date of the Party**

**8. Party Location**



Made a data table from the following data and stored in an Excel file.





It took me approx. **30mins** to make the process run to complete the task.

Total time to process  400 Screenshots : **06:25:45 hrs**

#### ( Quite long time but fast than a human typing from each screenshot)
